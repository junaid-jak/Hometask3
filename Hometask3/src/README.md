# Hometask3: Vehicle Engine Hierarchy

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a vehicle engine hierarchy using Java's inheritance and abstraction concepts. It includes a superclass `Engine` with subclasses for different engine types (`CombustionEngine`, `ElectricEngine`, and `HybridEngine`). It also includes a `Vehicle` superclass with three subclasses (`ICEV`, `BEV`, and `HybridV`), each using a `Manufacture` and `Engine` attribute.

## Steps to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the project into Eclipse.
3. Run the `Main` class to see the results.

## Development Environment

- Java SE 11
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers

**Matriculation Number:** 7222074
